A tiny and powerful PHP micro-framework. Attempts to be [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/),
[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) and
[PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) compliant. Also uses the [ADR](https://github.com/pmjones/adr)
pattern. You should too!

To get started, check out [the documentation](http://spark.readthedocs.org).
There's also a [sample project](https://github.com/sparkphp/project) that shows
the best way to use this framework and is a quick way to start a new project.
